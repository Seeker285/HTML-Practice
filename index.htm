<p style="border:2px solid Violet">HTML also uses about 140 predated color names, or RGB/HEX/HSL/RGBA/HSLA values, to assign a color when called by the style element. This affects both background and font colors.</p> 
<p style="border:2px dotted DodgerBlue">We can even use it with borders!</p>
<p style="background-color:rgba(255,99,71)">Though, it makes it look like something from the 90s.</p>

<p>RGB, HEX, HSL, RGBA, and HSLA all use different value types to assign a color:</p>
<ul>
<li>RGB: Uses <I>red, green, and blue</I> to determine the final color.<p style="color:rgb(120, 87, 0)">rgb(120, 87, 0) creates a shade of brown.</p></li>
<li>HEX: Uses a <I>hexadecimal value</I> to determine the final color, with a # preceding it. The format is #rrggbb where red (rr), green (gg) and blue (bb) are displayed by a value between 00-ff (ff being the highest).<p style="color:#00ff88">#000888 creates a shade of green.</p></li>
<li>HSL: Uses <I>hue, saturation, and lightness</I> to determine the final color. Hue is degree on the color wheel, 0-360. Red is 0, 120 is green, and 240 is blue. Saturation is the percentage of color value, with 0% being a shade of gray and 100% being the full color. Lastly, lightness is a percentage of brightness, with 0% being black and 100% being white.
<p style="color:hsl(200, 95%, 25%)">hsl(200, 95%, 25%) creates a shade of blue.</p></li>
<li>RGBA: Uses the same <I>red, green, and blue</I> parameters as RGB, but with the addition of <I>alpha</I>. Alpha affects the transparency of the color on a scale of 0.0 (fully transparent) to 1.0 (fully opaque).<p style="color:rgba(120, 87, 0, 0.5)">rgba(120, 87, 0, 0.5) is a transparent brown.</p></li>
<li>HSLA: Uses the same <I>hue, saturation, and lightness</I> parameters as HSL, but with the addition of <I>alpha</I>. Alpha affects the transparency of the color on a scale of 0.0 (fully transparent) to 1.0 (fully opaque).<p style="color:hsla(200, 95%, 25%, 0.5)">hsla(200, 95%, 25%, 0.5) is a transparent blue.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Here are a few quotes from the world famous hero, Link:</p>
<blockquote cite="https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/boards/632936-the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild/75161603">
"I can't see you" to Hestu.<br> 
"You like this corner?" to the girl in Hateno's cloth shop.<br>
"Paraglider. Now!" to Old man.

<p>Link has always been the hero of The <abbr title="Legend of Zelda">LoZ</abbr> series, though he is rarely ever the same Link in the individual games.</p>

	This standard of coding keeps the coder's format
This includes tabbing, spaces, and line breaks
     It is also displayed in a fixed-width font
		It is considered a preformatted text

<address>
Look at this fancy format<br>
This is an example of the address element<br>
You can never guess what it is used for<br>
(If you said addresses, why are you even here?)
